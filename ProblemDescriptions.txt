problem #1
Description:
Fuel required to launch a given module? is based on its mass. Take the module's mass, divide it by three, round down to integer, and subtract 2.
Fuel needed = floor(mass/3)-2
Input: mass
Output: fuel needed

Question: total fuel needed for many modules
Total fuel needed = sum of fuel needed for each mass

Pseudo code:

object module
members int mass; 
member funcion int getFuelNeededToLaunch();

int getFuelNeededToLaunch()
{
	//throw error if mass < 0
	return floor(mass/3.0)-2;
}

int GetFuelNecessaryForAllModules(module[] modules)
{
	int totalFuel = 0;
	foreach module m in modules
	{
		totalFuel += m.getFuelNeededToLaunch();
	}
	return totalFuel;
}
